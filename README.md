# A* Pathfinding Algorithm with SDL

This project demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library to provide a graphical interface. The code defines a grid with nodes that can act as obstacles, start points, or end points for the A* algorithm.

## Features

- Custom Priority Queue for A* algorithm
- Obstacle, Start, and Goal can be set dynamically in the GUI

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler
- SDL 2.0


## Build Instructions

To build the project, simply run the `build.py` script:

```bash
python build.py
This will compile the project into an executable.
```
## Running the Program
After building, execute the generated binary to start the program. A window should appear displaying a grid that you can edit. Left click to make the destination and Right click to add obstacles.
